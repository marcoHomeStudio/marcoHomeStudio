- 👋 Hi, I’Marco
- 👀 I’m an enthusiastic hobihist and semi professional for embedded electronic projects including, arduino, espressif, stm microcontrollers.
I’m a former network and IT consultant and have a broad range vision of IT infrastructure backend and front end including IOT system and networking security.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning android app development with android studio. I'm also digging into the STM cube world and atmel studio to get rid of the arduino layer if possible.
- 💞️ I’m trying to develop a new career in freelancing consultancy in embedded system and IOT infrastructure
